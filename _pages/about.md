Welcome to my site! I'm Nihaal Bhojwani, currently an undergraduate computer science student at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/), with a concentration in machine learning. I am passionate about the intersection of AI and science, particularly in relation to physics, space, and rocketry.

I am currently conducting machine learning research at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/), mentored by [Prof. Animashree Anankumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/), where I develop new AI methods to enable and accelerate scientific applications. Previously, I worked at [NASA Ames Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/) as an AI/ML Research Intern under the guidance of [Manoj Agrawal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manojagr/) and [Dr. Krishna Kalyanam](https://www.nasa.gov/people/krishna-kalyanam/), building an air traffic control recommendation system. Additionally, I interned at [Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/index.html) as a machine learning engineer under [Joe Worsham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeworsham/), where I developed time-series forecasting algorithms.

I plan to pursue a PhD after graduating in December 2025. In the long term, I aim to deepen our understanding of the physical world through AI and contribute to advancing space exploration and making humanity a multiplanetary species.

On a personal note, I enjoy sports, traveling, and writing. I am an avid fan of the [New England Patriots](https://www.patriots.com/) and [Maryland Terrapins](https://umterps.com/). I also love exploring new places and will be studying abroad in Madrid during the Spring 2025 semester. Lastly, I have a passion for creative writing and aspire to publish a novel one day.
